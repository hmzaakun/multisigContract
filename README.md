# 🚀 Multisignature Wallet Contract

This **Multisignature Wallet** contract is a secure and collaborative way to manage transactions, requiring multiple signers to confirm before executing any transaction. It’s perfect for teams, DAOs, or shared accounts!

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Multi-Signer Wallet**: Transactions require approvals from multiple signers.
- **Flexible Management**: Add or remove signers dynamically.
- **Transaction Workflow**:
  1. **Submit**: A signer proposes a transaction.
  2. **Confirm**: Other signers confirm the transaction.
  3. **Execute**: Once enough confirmations are gathered, the transaction is executed.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

### **1️⃣ Initialization**

- On deployment, the contract requires **3 initial signers** (including the deployer).
- The number of confirmations required for transaction execution is set to `2` by default.

---

### **2️⃣ Transactions**

- **Submitting Transactions**:

  - Any signer can propose a transaction by calling `submitTransaction(address to, uint256 value, bytes data)`.
  - Adds the transaction to the queue for approval.

- **Confirming Transactions**:

  - A signer approves a transaction by calling `confirmTransaction(uint256 txId)`.
  - Increases the confirmation count for the transaction.

- **Revoking Confirmations**:

  - A signer can revoke their confirmation using `revokeConfirmation(uint256 txId)`.

- **Executing Transactions**:
  - Once the required confirmations are gathered, a transaction can be executed via `executeTransaction(uint256 txId)`.
  - Funds are transferred, and the transaction is marked as executed.

---

### **3️⃣ Signer Management**

- **Add Signers**:

  - Add a new signer using `addSigner(address newSigner)`.
  - Ensures no duplicate or invalid addresses.

- **Remove Signers**:
  - Remove a signer using `removeSigner(address signerToRemove)`.
  - Maintains a minimum of 3 signers.
